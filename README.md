# BuncoBot
Simple Discord.py bot meant to assist with bunco.  Rolls dice and can move users to different voice channels.  Keeps track of the crown and allows for ringing by head table for the start and stopping of a round.

This bot does not keep score as the players preferred to do that themselves.

When running, please create your own tokenstorage.py with your token = '######' in the same folder as start.py

Also, please copy the Channel IDs of the channels you've designated for head, middle, and lower table and change them in settings.py
